<div id="MainInfo1"> <p> <span id="welcome">Hello and welcome to my incredible website!</span> <br>
My name is Kristina Savova and I'm in Grade 12, as I study at the American College of Sofia in Bulgaria. 
I'm interested in music and programming (from about one year), as you will see in the webpages I've created. </p> </div>

<br><br><br><br>

<div id="MainInfo2"> <p> My small, modest, but awesome website consists of four main parts: a Travel, Recipe Book, Blog, and Invitation webpage. 
You can reach them if you click at the upper part of this page. They demonstrate <span>my progress throughout the school year 2017-2018 (you can see how every webpage is better than the previous one)</span>. 
I really hope you enjoy it, and please <span>spread the word</span>! Tell your friends, your acquantances, your... <i>dog of the brother of the aunt of your best friend about it</i>. 
Thank you so much for visiting my website! Love you all! <br>
Regards, <br>
Krissi

P.S. <span>I love Comic Sans MS!!! :D :D :D</span> <br>
